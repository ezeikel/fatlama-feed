## Technologies Used:
- create-react-app
- react-router-dom
- axios
- styled-components
- CSS Grid + Custom Properties

## Why
- `create-react-app`: to get up and running really quickly and it provides a nice project structure to get you going.
- `react-router-dom`: to navigate between components.
- 'axios`: could have used the Fetch API but I know `axios` does a few extra things behind the scenese to make life easier .e.g you dont have to call `.json()` on the data returned back from an API. It does this for you.
- `styled-components`: I'm a fan of `styled-components` as It feels a bit more natural for writing CSS. e.g. no camel cased naming. Also, I like the fact you can pass `props` in and use it to conditionally style something.
- `CSS Grid + Custom Properties`: The new hotness ðŸ”¥. Grid makes it easy to layout most things and css variables make reusable styles easy.

## Improvements
- Make it responsive
- Better displaying of errors to user
- Making `styled-components` component library
